This work is based on previous TAPR projects, [the echOmods project](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), the [un0rick project](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.377054), and the [lit3rick project](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5792245) - their boards are open hardware and software, developped with open-source elements as much as possible.
